## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>How accurate are the sizes and distances?</b></summary>

Both sizes and distances are scaled for visualization purposes:

**Sizes**:

- Terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) use relatively accurate size ratios
- Gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) are significantly compressed - shown at 2.5-4x their actual relative size to prevent them from dominating the view

**Distances**:

- Heavily compressed using a non-linear scale to fit all planets in one view
- Example: In reality, Neptune is 30x farther from the Sun than Earth, but in this visualization it's only ~5.6x
- This allows you to see the entire solar system at once

The focus is on educational exploration and visual clarity rather than scientific precision. For actual scale models, distances would make inner planets invisible or outer planets too distant to see.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use this for educational purposes?</b></summary>

Absolutely! This project is open-source and free to use. It's perfect for classrooms, presentations, or personal learning. We'd love to hear how you're using it!

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Will my device run this smoothly?</b></summary>

The application is optimized for modern browsers. It runs best on desktop computers with WebGL support. Mobile devices are supported but may have reduced performance, especially with all objects visible.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I add my own planets or moons?</b></summary>

Yes! The data for all celestial bodies is in the `src/data/` directory. You can add or modify planets, moons, and satellites by editing those files. See the Configuration section for details.
